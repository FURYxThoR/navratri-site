        <p>Navratri is a Hindu festival celebrated twice a year in the country – during the months of Chaitra (March-April) and Sharada (October-November). The word Navratri means nine nights in Sanskrit and is a festival that spans nine days in both these months. For these nine days, nine Navratri colors are designated, each with its significance.

        Navratri is celebrated in different ways in different parts of the country. However, the triumph of the Hindu goddess Kali or Durga is the basic idea behind the celebration. 
        <br>
        Navratri is loved and cherished by countless women across the country, who fast, prepare special foods and beverages, dress up and visit friends and family all through these nine days. The Chaitra Navaratri culminates in Ram Navami and the Sharada Navaratri culminates in Durga Puja and Vijayadashami.
